# This tool requires git, make, and racket along with 
# gimp (> 2.0) and should be run upon every update of racket or gimp
#
# All libraries are built and placed in the directory this script is run from,
# so run it in an EMPTY DIRECTORY unless you know what you're doing
#
# (shameless plug) If you plan or running racket from the command line, I would also 
# recommend that you add (require rackunit) to your ~/.racketrc file,
# it makes command line racket much more managable (/shameless plug)
#
# I bulit this tool on Arch linux, and while it should work on your distro/computer,
# I can make no guarantees.
